# PicoNN

# This is a testing and announcement for...

[PicoNN](https://github.com/pliptor/PicoNN)

The code is being tested now and will be uploaded soon.
It's a fully functional self-contained C++ neural network testing and study platform.
It has less than 500 lines of code but has zero dependencies. No Theano, no Python, no CUDA.
It is not meant for a full blown application platform. It is meant for those that
are trying to understand NN and want to have some fun and look at the individual components at the lower levels
in simple C++ code.
